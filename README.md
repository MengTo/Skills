# skills

Local repo for MengTo/skills.

## What’s inside
- `agent-skills/` — Clawdbot AgentSkills drafts (web design + UI prompting).

## Conventions
- Each skill lives in its own folder and includes a required `SKILL.md`.
- Optional `REFERENCES.md` files hold links only (keep SKILL.md lean).

## Next
- When you’re ready, we’ll create `MengTo/skills` on GitHub and push this repo.
