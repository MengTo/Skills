# Meng To’s UI Prompting Playbook (Draft)

AI doesn’t make great design.
It makes **average design fast**.
Your edge is still taste + craft.

Here’s the workflow that actually ships.

---

## 1) Screenshots beat prompts
One screenshot contains **fonts, spacing, colors, icons, layout**.
Gemini 3 reads it instantly.

**Rule:** Stop writing 1000-word descriptions.
Start collecting references.

---

## 2) The hero section is half the job
Hero = your cover image for social.
Everything else is secondary.

**Workflow**
- Use **Superhero** to collect hero references
- Lock hero first
- Build the rest section-by-section

---

## 3) Templates are leverage
Template business prints money.
Sell on **Webflow / Framer / UI8** for ~$50–$100.
Stack enough and it compounds.

**Rule:** Build assets, not one-offs.

---

## 4) Taste is the moat
AI raises the baseline.
Your visual judgment becomes the differentiator, not your Figma speed.

**Rule:** Curate hard.
Ship fewer, better.

---

## 5) Avoid AI slop
Common slop:
- purple gradients
- Lucide icons everywhere
- generic layout rhythm

**Fix**
- Switch to **Iconify Solar** for variety (outline, broken, duotone)

---

## 6) Use Simple Icons (logos) via Iconify
Stop hunting SVGs.
Use Simple Icons via Iconify for brand logos.

**Rule:** One API reference in your prompt.
No more manual logo scavenger hunts.

---

## 7) Work section-by-section (not full-page)
Build in Aura / v0 / Cursor:
- hero → features → footer

**Benefit:** faster iterations + better creative control.

---

## 8) Remix everything
Great sources:
- **Mobbin** (sites → sections)
- **Bento Grids** (cards)

**Workflow:** screenshot → remix → change colors/text/animation → make it yours.

---

## 9) Use negative prompts like guardrails
Add constraints:
- “Don’t change anything else.”
- “Keep the hero.”

**Benefit:** prevents AI from breaking what already works.

---

## 10) Fix images manually (AI breaks them)
When images are wrong:
- generate replacements in **Midjourney** or **Nano Banana Pro**
- swap them in

**Rule:** Don’t wait for the model to get it perfect.
Patch the weak link.

---

## 11) Typography still matters
Google Fonts are free + AI-friendly.
Inter is overused—try:
- **Newsreader**
- **Playfair Display**

**Rule:** pick one type “move” that signals taste.

---

## 12) Add craft signals
Small details that instantly level up:
- 01/02/03 numbering
- container-sized grid lines
- subtle beam/noodle animations
- hero backgrounds via **Unicorn Studio**

---

## 13) Steal better headlines
Hooks = conversions.
Use:
- H1 Gallery
- http://cta.gallery

---

## 14) Present properly (social is distribution)
- Record with **Screen Studio**
- Screenshot on polished backgrounds

**Rule:** presentation is part of the product.

---

## 15) Speed trick: pick the right model
- **GPT‑5.1** for small text/color tweaks
- **Gemini 3** for complex UI generation

---

## Bottom line
**Superhero** for heroes.
**Mobbin** for sections.
**Bento Grids** for cards.
**Iconify** for icons.

**Screenshot → Gemini 3 → Remix → Polish**
Your taste curates.
AI executes.
